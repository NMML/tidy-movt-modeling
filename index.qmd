title: "Welcome to Tidy Movement Modeling with R"
---

## A Pragmatic Guide 

The `crawl` package for R (and supporting friends e.g. `pathroutr`, `momentuHMM`) is 
designed and built with the idea that it should be 
accessible and useful to a research biologist with some intermediate R
skills and an understanding of the basic statistical theory behind 
the analysis of animal movement. This website will focus on 
providing the user with suggested principles, workflows, and pragmatic
approaches that, if followed, should make analysis with `crawl` more
efficient and reliable.

> Telemetry data are collected on a wide range of species and come in a number
> of formats and data structures. The code and examples provided here were
> developed from data the authors are most familiar with. You will very 
> likely **NOT** be able to just copy and paste the code and apply to your data.
> We suggest you focus more on understanding what the code is doing and then
> write your own version of the code to meet your data and your research needs.
